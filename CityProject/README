Project 4 - 3D city scene

To compile use the following commands:
cmake .
make
./CityProject.x

The program should cover all the specifications asked in the assignment. In our program we have buildings, moving cars, parked cars, background, a sky box, mailboxes, billboards, street signs. 

Most buildings are randomly generated, where the height of buildings being increasingly higher as you get toward the center of the city. The textures of buildings are also mostly randomly generated.
